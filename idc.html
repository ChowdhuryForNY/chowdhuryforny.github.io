								<h3>What is the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) and why should I care?</h3>
								<h4>What is the problem?</h4>
								<p>When you open up the list of State Senators in New York, you'll notice there's a Democratic majority. Then you ask yourself, why are progressive policies so hard to pass? Here's why. <strong>The Republican's effectively have a majority in the State Senate, even though more Democrats have been elected to that office.</strong></p>
								<h4>How does that work?</h4>
								<p>While the Republicans are working together, caucusing with each other, and cosponsoring legislation, <strong>there are eight rogue Democrats who call themselves the IDC. The IDC votes along Republican party lines even though they were elected as Democrats,</strong> against what they're constituents elected them as. </p>
								<h4>Why would these Democrats turn their backs on their constituents and their voters?</h4>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
										<h4>Money</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Some Senators have racked up quite a bit of personal credit card debt uncovered by investigations.</li>
											<li>The IDC and the Republican's are proposing legislation that increases their salary by $30k while the communities suffer.</li>
											<li>Joining the IDC can get them a few favors here and there. They might get a Committee position that will boost the amount of money they make.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
										<h4>Power</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>The IDC holds the Democrats in the state hostage with their votes.</li>
											<li>They serve as the swing votes that make or break legislation, giving them more power on the floor. The problem is, they advocate less for the principles you care about.</li>
											<li>They have and will always value their personal political ambitions more than their Community.</li>
											<li>In order to keep you happy, they will co-sponsor some progressive legislation, but they'll never propose it.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>
								<h3>Who's in the IDC and why should I care?</h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/IDC/cover.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Recognize anyone?</h4>
								<p>That's Jose Peralta, the New York State Senator from District 13. In 2010, he was elected in a Special Election on a progressive platform with support from hundreds of grassroots supporters and volunteers. Now he votes along Republican party lines.</p>
								<h4>Why does this matter so much?</h4>
								<p>Five days after Trump was inaugurated, Peralta announced his decision to join the IDC. Democrats throughout the nation are unifying and coming together under one progressive agenda to fight the Trump Administration and the Republican Congress, yet we have a State Senator breaking with his voters and the principles he was elected upon. It's absolutely essential that we elect a real progressive this year.</p>
								<center><h3>As Democrats across the nation come together to fight the Trump administration and the Republican controlled Congress, Peralta joined the Republicans. <br /> <br />Elect a real progressive!</h3></center>
